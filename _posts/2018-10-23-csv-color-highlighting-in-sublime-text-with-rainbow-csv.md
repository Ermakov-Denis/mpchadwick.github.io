If you're a developer, I'd be willing to wage a bet on the following...

- From time-to-time you work with data in CSV files
- You don't particularly enjoy working with Microsoft Excel 

At least for my self, I know these two statements are true.

For the longest time I hadn't thought to look for ways to improve the experience of working with CSV data in my text editor. Somehow the idea came into my mind recently.

This brought me to the [rainbow_csv](https://github.com/mechatroner/sublime_rainbow_csv) Sublime Text plugin. Installing it has been a game changer for me.

The plugin does more than just color highlighting, but that's the only feature I care about.

Here's an example of the highlighting in a CSV in the [Magento](https://magento.com/) code base which contains pricing data.

For any developers that use Sublime Text, I highly recommend this plugin.

For any developers that *don't* use Sublime text I highly recommend finding a similar plugin for your text editor of choice.
