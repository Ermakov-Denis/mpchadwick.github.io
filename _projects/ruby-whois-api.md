ruby-whois-api is a basic Sinatra wrapper for the Ruby WHOIS gem.

My work on Domain Clamp forced me to do [a deep dive on WHOIS parsing]({{site.url}}/blog/dealing-with-whois-records) at which point it was pretty clear that the Ruby gem was the best solution available.

ruby-whois-api is a minimal web service that receives domain name and responds with a parsed WHOIS record.
